Hey! you really shouldn't head out there!
I heard that its super dangerous these days!
......
Well if you're that determined....
At least take a sword!
.....
Come here and I'll pass it to you (press 'F' to interact with us)
Goodbye and Goodluck!




I'm Gort. I've always lived around these here parts.
Dangerous? It certainly is out here, but I ain't scared of nothin'!
.......
Have I alway's lived in a tree? Well no, but have you seen what's crawling around the grounds? One of 'em Golems almost got me once. They just keep coming back too.
Tell you what, if you can kill 5 of those Golems and come back to me...
I'll give you a treat. Just come back to me and press 'F' to hand their heads over.
Then I can be happy knowing I've exacted some revenge.


Oh you completed the task? And you're still alive? Damn kid, you sure did good!
Reward? Oh I suppose I did say something about that earlier huh? Well...
Here, have this, it'll prove helpful at some future point I'm sure.
Good luck out there buddy, 'ole Gort is betting on ya
I'm sure if anyone can save our forest, its you. 



I heard that anyone that can go out there and collect all 8 of the broken shards of the forest's soul and bring them back together will be able to save us all. 
I wonder who would ever be crazy enough to go out there....


I heard that a Capybara lives out there somewhere... He might need some help. I couldn't imagine living outside the safety of our clearing

Be careful if you end up in the tree tops! I heard bats have made their home up there. Those things are dangerous!

You collected all them sparks? Wowie! Maybe in a future update you'll get to fight a mini boss after doing that!
