Current Version: Prototype Release (V1.0.0.0)

Current known bugs in the prototype:

- Hotbar: Items tend to either duplicate in the hotbar, or the number doesn't update to show the correct amount. Using the items does not fully work as intended, as the hotbar was add in last minute as part of the inventory feature.
- Speed potion: No current timer attached to this, so the potion effects do not wear off and will simply stack
- Enemies: when stunning enemies, the player can slide back and forth while on top of them as the enemy sprite is free to slide about and is essentially a 'ragdoll'
